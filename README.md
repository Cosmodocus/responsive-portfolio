##Overview

I created this mainly using html and css, with some javascript functionality to create a hamburger navbar for mobile responsiveness.

This was by far the most html, and especially css I've ever commited to a project. This was also the most I've commited to the mediaqueries in a project. Overall, was the most I've put time and effort into a project, as of the time of creating it. 

It taught me a lot in terms of knowledge/understanding, as well as how I could improve, such as needing a better feel for UI/UX principles. It's mostly the projects section that I feel a bit awkward with, but realistically, the entire sections are awkward.

##FuturePlans
I plan to either reitirate this portfolio website, or create a completly new one with more added designs and technologies. I'm considering learning Tailwind CSS to streamline the process better. 

I also will need a lot more official content, such as projects, CV resume, written descriptions, etc. 

Animations would be awesome to add onto, and I hope I can learn a lot more about them when I return or start a new portfolio website.

Please feel free to add or edit as you please.
